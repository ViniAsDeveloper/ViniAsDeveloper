- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ViniAsDeveloper
- I'm still finishing secondary education, but I've been devoting a lot of time to programming for the past 5 years.
- I created desktop games in C and C++, and games for Facebook Games in JavaScript and TypeScript; without engines or frameworks. And I did a lot of programming in embedded systems for school projects.
- I'm currently working on a graphical API project for modern GPUs and on a tool that automates customer relationship management using locally run optimised AI models.
- I like modded Minecraft a lot. I've worked on two small Minecraft servers with mods as a sole programmer, and I'm still learning Java.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with everyone.
